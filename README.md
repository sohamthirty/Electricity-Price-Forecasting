# Electricity-Price-Forecasting

## Data
**[Hourly energy demand generation and weather | ENTSOE & REE](https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/nicholasjhana/energy-consumption-generation-prices-and-weather)**
The dataset includes hourly data on Energy Generation, Consumption, Pricing, and Weather from 2015 to 2018.

## Overview
• The project focuses on forecasting electrical prices in the energy market for Spain, leveraging Machine Learning techniques.</br>
• With the goal of predicting electrical prices based on generation, consumption, and weather data, the project explores the influence of different features on electrical prices.</br>
• Various time-series models, boosting models, and an LSTM model are implemented and compared based on their RMSE to determine the most suitable model and features for the problem at hand.
